            <p>This playground takes its name from Harvard University, the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. The university was founded in 1636, only 16 years after the arrival of the Pilgrims at Plymouth. Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard was named in 1638 for its first benefactor, John Harvard, a minister from Charlestown, Massachusetts who bequeathed half of his estate and his library to the school two years after its founding. Seven United States Presidents have been educated at Harvard and the school remains a prestigious research university to this day.

                <p>Great academics with a variety of concentrations, classes, and world-renowned professors. Great extracurricular life and the ability to network with alumni, staff, and other students to reach your goals career-wise. However, this institution falls flat when it comes to social life..</p>
